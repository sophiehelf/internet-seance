<h3><em>What is this?</em></h3>
<p>Imagine that the internet is a house and each webpage is a room. When we travel through the web, we move from room to room, interacting with things in each one, looking around, doing what we need or want to do.</p>
<p>What happens when no one wants to use a room anymore? It is abandoned. So are some websites, eventually.</p>
<p>And now we must ask: if a house can be haunted, why can't the internet be? The internet is full of virtual closets (to which our passwords are the keys); web pages and entire websites are abandoned and forgotten about; the content we leave behind sits alone and begins to fall apart. It begins to move. It begins to shift. It comes alive, and sometimes it speaks to us.</p>
<p>This dead content oozes its way through cracks and code breaks and shows up in the oddest of places - in CAPTCHAs, in spam emails, in halfway-loaded pages. We can write these incidents off as mistakes, or we can see them for what they are: ghosts, spirits of the internet.</p>
<p>This website harnesses the power of these ghosts in a sort of internet Ouija board which is free for you to use. The internet spirits know and understand more than we may realise, and it is important for us to listen to them. Don't be afraid to hear what they have to say.</p>
