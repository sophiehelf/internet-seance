# Internet Seance

A simple website created for my third year final project at Central Saint Martins. Includes a Javascript "ouija board" with which you can contact the ghosts of the internet. Spooky!

This was created before I really learned web design/coding and as such has lots of flaws that will be fixed when I have the time.
